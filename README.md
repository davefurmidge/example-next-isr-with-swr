> Lightning fast static pages with [ISR](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#incremental-static-regeneration), instantly updated with [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app) ⚡️

## FYI

This demo uses demo data stored in `src/mock-db`. Changes to posts won't be saved on refresh in this example, but would be if hooked up to a real-world database.
